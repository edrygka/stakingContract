# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

Users stake different quantities of ERC-20 token named “TKN”. Assume that an external caller would periodically transfer reward TKNs to a staking smart contract (no need to implement this logic). Rewards are proportionally distributed based on staked TKN.

Contract caller can:
- Stake
- Unstake (would be a plus if caller can unstake part of stake)
- See how many tokens each user can unstake

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
